# RSSignal-LoRa

This repository contains the source code of a proposed validation framework called `RSSignal`.

RSSignal uses [RSSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication) (Received Signal Strength Indication) measurements as input, process them through some steps and generates a key/password ready to be used by any cryptographically secure encryption algorithms (such as [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)).

The limited resources of IoT devices, the reproducibility of the obtained results and the key randomness aspects were taken into consideration during the process of development of the framework.

## NOTE

This README file still in a "work in progress" state, so expect to see some TODO's

## Motivation

Given the number of IoT devices already deployed worldwide, the wide range of possibilities related to the LoRa and LoRaWAN technologies, the [key distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_distribution) problem and the lack of reproducibility of experiments related to key generation in IoT environments, this work proposes an open source framework that tries to address some of those issues.

As explained on other work [[Gao et al., 2019]](https://doi.org/10.3390/s19235122), [[Yang et al., 2017]](https://www.dit.uoi.gr/e-class/modules/document/file.php/193/LPWAN/LPWAN%20Security%20Options/Thesis_Xueying%20%281%29.pdf), [[Yang et al., 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1109/IoTDI.2018.00022), sending such an important request (as the Join Request is) in plain text can be considered a security vulnerability because it opens up the possibility of a wide range of attacks to be performed. To avoid situations like this and to help developing another solution to key generation based on RSSI measurements and PHY techniques, an open source validation framework was deployed.

## File structure

On the root of the repository, goes all the files required to run the framework (more details in the subsection below)

The `modules` folder contains all the external modules used by the framework, they should be recursively cloned together with this repository or could be obtained separately later on

The `dataset-files` folder should contain the data set source files which will be used as input in the framework

The `results` folder contains all the intermediate files generated by each step of the framework. Each step creates its own folder to keep everything more clear and easy to find

[TODO] Explain the other sub-folders

### File naming pattern

Each file has the step name which it belongs to appended as a prefix of the file name

[TODO] Expand on the naming pattern

## Using this project

Please, make sure your environment meets the requirements below if you want to run the framework.

### Requirements

\- An UNIX-like platform <!-- TODO update this -->

\- [GNU BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) 5.1.16 or above or other [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) interpreter

\- Python 3.10.2 or above

\- [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) 1.22.2 or above

<!-- \- [CommPy](https://github.com/veeresht/CommPy) (scikit-commpy) 0.7.0 or above -->

\- [Reed-Solomon Codec](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/reedsolomon) 1.5.4

\- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) 1.1.1n or 3.0 or above

### General instructions

1. Clone the source code using:

<code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/oliveiraleo/RSSignal-LoRa.git</code>

**Note:** The option ```--recursive``` will clone our code + all the modules required

2.

[TODO] Write full instructions

## FAQ

Some frequently asked questions and their answers

**-> Q: Where are the "step 2" files?**

A: We didn't focus on any step that involved the real world environment implementation because, as stated in our work, RSSI is available in a range of wireless technologies (e.g. WiFi, ZigBee, LoRa, etc) and each one has its own standards which affects how the implementation would be done.

**-> Q: Why so many different files? Wouldn't it be better to keep everything together and avoid some overhead?**

A: Yes, it might would. However, we tried to be as didactic and modular as possible, then we tried to reduce the dependability between the modules so they can be more easily swapped.

**-> Q: Why did you choose Reed Solomon instead of X?**

\- A: As mentioned on the work by [[DaCruz et al., 2022]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phycom.2021.101480), for certain applications, maybe a convolutional approach might fit better, but for our project we thought that the RS codec suffices the requirements and still is as easy to understand.

**-> Q: Why the Reed Solomon (RS) codec does not work for me?**

A: Please, note that the total number of RSSI measurements obtained from both sides should be equal. If they are different (or for some reason they were modified during the pre processing step), chances are that the RS codec will fail to correct the bits.
