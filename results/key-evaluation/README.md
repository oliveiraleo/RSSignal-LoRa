# key-evaluation

This folder contains the raw results from NIST test suite.

In our publications, because of display constraints (page size, etc), the results were rounded, so we decided to publish the raw results directly extracted from the output of suite for people to check and compare with those they obtained.

The relationship with each dataset file and its key evaluation is displayed below:

## Dataset #1

- DaCruz2021-preliminar1 -> key-eval-preliminar1
- DaCruz2021-preliminar2 -> key-eval-preliminar2
- DaCruz2021-coleta -> key-eval-coleta

## Dataset #2

- Simka2022-P0 -> key-eval-Simka2022-P0

## Dataset #3

- DeOliveira2022-coleta-estatica1 -> key-eval-estatica1
- DeOliveira2022-coleta-estatica2 -> key-eval-estatica2
- DeOliveira2022-coleta-estatica3 -> key-eval-estatica3
- DeOliveira2022-coleta-lenta ->  key-eval-lenta
- DeOliveira2022-coleta-rapida -> key-eval-rapida
